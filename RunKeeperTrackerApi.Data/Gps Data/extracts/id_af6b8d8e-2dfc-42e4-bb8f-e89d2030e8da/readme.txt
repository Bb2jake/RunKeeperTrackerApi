About Your Data Extract
-----------------------

These folders contain raw extracts of your data from Runkeeper's data warehouse. The files are standard CSV (Comma Separated Value) files, encoded with UTF-8.  They can be opened by Microsoft Excel, Google Docs, or a variety of open-source software like LibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org/).

Why do we gather data in the first place?
-----------------------------------------

Most of the data you see here is necessary for the Runkeeper app and website to function correctly.  We analyze this data in the aggregate to understand how our users are using the app and to determine what we should improve or work on next.  When there are issues with the app this is also the first place we look to understand what’s going wrong.

If you have any additional questions please reach out to our support team at support@runkeeper.com.

Additional details about the files in your export are as follows:

Training Plan Participation
---------------------------

This file lists your interactions with several different training plan options that exist within the Runkeeper app, including Pace Academy, Prescribed Workouts, and Adaptive Workouts.  In particular, you will see when you signed up for each plan, which workouts you have completed, and (if applicable to the plan) a record of your completion of the plan.

Runkeeper uses this data to understand how our users are faring in various different types of training plans and to plan and develop adjustments as necessary.

App and Web Visit Data
----------------------

This file lists the days where you have either opened the Runkeeper app or logged in to the website.  We've included our best guess as to which country you were in at the time, but this information may be incorrect or unavailable in some cases.

Runkeeper uses this data to understand which users are still using our service; we need to know which users are active to be able to fulfill various legal obligations, including automatic opt-outs and account deletion under the GDPR.

Runkeeper Store Purchase Records
--------------------------------

This file lists items that you have purchased from the Runkeeper store, including price and when the items were purchased.  Note that if there are items missing here, you may have checked out using a different email address than the one on your main Runkeeper account.

Runkeeper uses this data to understand which products are popular with our users and to manage certain follow-up communications, such as review / feedback requests.

Goals
-----

This file lists goals that you have created and tracked through the Runkeeper service.  Where available, it includes the start and end dates set for the goal, the percentage of progress made against the goal, and a verbal description of the goal.  If the goal is commpleted you will also see a completion date.

At a high level, Runkeeper uses this information to understand what motivates users like you and to understand what sorts of goals are (or aren't) reasonable.  You can see some of the results of analysis we've done on this goal data here:

Challenges and Other Events
---------------------------

This file records your participation in past Runkeeper challenges and similar events (including running groups and featured workouts).  You will what type of event you signed up for, when it ended, and (if applicable) when you completed it.

In the Runkeeper app, we use this data to display which challenges and featured workouts you are engaged in or have completed; without it, we would not be able to offer these events (or the rewards for completing challenges) to users.

Runkeeper Challenges serve a number of purposes—they motivate users to work out more, create moments of achievement that users can share with each other and the world, and more.  We often run challenges and featured workouts in collaboration with other brands, and it's important to be able to report back high-level statistics on the groups of users participating in these events.  Some of the ways we use this data include:

* Understanding the aggregate profile of users who sign up for and complete challenges, in terms of demographics (age groups, gender, country) and in terms of performance
* For competitive challenges like our Global 5K events, we use this information as the first step in identifying rankings, which are then reported back to users through the website and email.

Note that the data you see here is not shared directly with any companies outside of the Runkeeper / ASICS family; outside brands only have access to aggregate statistics.  That means that an outside brand would know how many men and women signed up for a challenge they sponsored (for instance), but would not know which specific users signed up or receive information on those individual users.

Tracked Shoes
-------------

This file lists the current status of all pairs of shoes that you have tracked with Runkeeper, including details on which shoes are active, how much distance you have tracked on them, and what the model of shoe is.

In the Runkeeper app, we use this information to show which pairs of shoes were used with which activities and to provide you stats on the pairs of shoes that you own (such as distance logged).

Runkeeper and ASICS use this information to understand how people are using their shoes — how long each pair lasts, what types of activities are tracked with what sorts of shoes, and what models of shoe are most popular.

Activities With Shoe Tracking
-----------------------------

This file lists activities that you have completed that are tied to specific pairs of tracked shoes.  The IDs in this file map back to those found in the Tracked Shoes file and the Cardio Activities list.

In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
----------------------------------

This file lists subscriptions, promotional credits, and pre-2014 training plan purchases that you have made, either in the Runkeeper app or on the Runkeeper website.  Where possible we have tried to list subscription billing details and the current status of any Runkeeper Go subscriptions that you have signed up for.

As a business, Runkeeper needs data on how people are spending money with us.  We need to know who has paid for an item(s) so that we can determine which products and services to deliver to purchasers.  In particular, this data is used to understand how subscribers sign up, renew, and lapse from the Runkeeper Go subscription service.

Third Party App Connections
---------------------------

This file lists connections (active and inactive) that you have made to third-party applications through the Runkeeper HealthGraph API.  Typically, these connections are created to share data between services; you will need to reach out to the listed third-parties to know what data they are storing from you.

Runkeeper uses this data to understand which third-party integrations are most popular with our users, and occasionally to debug third-party connections that are causing issues due to erroneous behavior.

Runkeeper Friends
-----------------

This file is a list of your current friends in the Runkeeper app, including the date when the connection was first created.  Friends are identified by the name that is shown in-app.

Internally, Runkeeper use this information to gauge value derived from our connected community of users, and to control access to your content (by default, only your in-app friends can see your activities and profile information).

Liked Content
-------------

This file lists content in your Runkeeper friends feed that you have 'liked' by pressing the heart icon.  Typically, this content consists of your friends' activities.

Runkeeper uses this information to make sure that your friends can see that you have 'liked' their activities.

Authored Comments
-----------------

This file lists comments that you have made.  Typically, these are comments on activities (either those of friends or your own), or comments in the chat section of the Running Groups feature.

Runkeeper uses this information to populate the comments section of activities.
